# Problem: Determine if a fruit is ripe, overripe, or unripe based on its color. (e.g., Banana: Green - Unripe, Yellow - Ripe, Brown - Overripe)

fruit = "Banana"  # Remove the extra dot before 'fruit'
color = "Green"

if fruit == "Banana":
    if color == "Green":
        print("unripe")  # Add correct indentation

    elif color == "Yellow":
        print("ripe")  # Add correct indentation

    elif color == "Brown":    
        print("overripe")  # Add correct indentation
